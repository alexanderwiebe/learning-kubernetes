# Learning Kubernetes

I see Kubernetes (and similar technologies) bridging clients from 'on premises' to the cloud[1]. The learning plan I am looking at consists of 3 parts, training, certification, and a conference. The goal being that I am certified prior to the conference.

## Notes:

This section divides up the topics contained within kubernetes into different areas of study.

## Conference:

- [KubeCon / CloudNativeCon 2020 or 2021](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/)
  - Registration (\$1050 USD)
  - 5 nights @ $200/night ($1000 USD)
  - Flights (\$800 CAD)

Each of the exams come with a free retake so I figure I'll go through the pluralsight and udemy courses, try the exams and if I fail then try the Cloud Native Computing Foundation courses. To get the certifications has the following breakdown:

| Action     | Low Cost (\$) | High Cost (\$) | Cost Videos (hr) | Cost Studying (hr) |
| ---------- | ------------: | -------------: | ---------------: | -----------------: |
| CKA cert   |           300 |            599 |               80 |                 80 |
| CKAD cert  |           300 |            599 |               "" |                 "" |
| Conference |          3000 |           3000 |               40 |                    |
| Total      |          3600 |           4200 |              120 |                 80 |

The total cost for exams and certification are $600 - $1200 and approximately 160 hours.
The total cost for the conference would be roughly \$3000 and last 1 week.

Overall, I think this email provides a template how a developer would go through learning Kubernetes. Further, Solvera could pursue the Kubernetes Certified Service Provider if 3 developers are able to achieve the CKA certification.

[1] - Kubernetes provides an abstraction over infrastructure (servers) and applications (containers). Together these would allow a company to take a monolithic app, 'lift and shift' it to the cloud, and add/rewrite functionality piecemeal in modern technologies. In the coming years moving monolithic apps to container orchestration systems so greenfield and maintenance work can coexist on hybrid cloud solutions without requiring a total redevelopment of the systems.
