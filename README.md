# Learning Kubernetes
I see Kubernetes (and similar technologies) bridging clients from 'on premises' to the cloud[1].  The learning plan I am looking at consists of 3 parts, training, certification, and a conference.  The goal being that I am certified prior to the conference.

## Certification:
* ### Individual:
  * [ ] [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Program ($300 USD)](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/)
  * [ ] [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) Program ($300 USD)](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/)
* ### Corporate:
  * [ ] [Kubernetes Certified Service Provider](https://www.cncf.io/certification/kcsp/)

## Conference:
* [KubeCon / CloudNativeCon 2020 or 2021](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/)
  * Registration ($1050 USD)
  * 5 nights @ $200/night ($1000 USD)
  * Flights ($800 CAD)

Each of the exams come with a free retake so I figure I'll go through the pluralsight and udemy courses, try the exams and if I fail then try the Cloud Native Computing Foundation courses.  To get the certifications has the following breakdown:

| Action | Low Cost ($) | High Cost ($) | Cost Videos (hr) | Cost Studying (hr) |
| ------ |-------------:|--------------:|-----------------:|-------------------:|
| CKA cert | 300        | 599           | 80               | 80                 |
| CKAD cert | 300       | 599           | ""               | ""                 |
| Conference | 3000     | 3000          | 40               |                    |
| Total | 3600          | 4200          | 120              | 80                 |

The total cost for exams and certification are $600 - $1200 and approximately 160 hours.
The total cost for the conference would be roughly $3000 and last 1 week.

Overall, I think this email provides a template how a developer would go through learning Kubernetes.  Further, Solvera could pursue the Kubernetes Certified Service Provider if 3 developers are able to achieve the CKA certification.

[1] - Kubernetes provides an abstraction over infrastructure (servers) and applications (containers).  Together these would allow a company to take a monolithic app, 'lift and shift' it to the cloud, and add/rewrite functionality piecemeal in modern technologies.  In the coming years moving monolithic apps to container orchestration systems so greenfield and maintenance work can coexist on hybrid cloud solutions without requiring a total redevelopment of the systems.
